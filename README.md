This is a production-ready React (JavaScript) scaffold for the Green Gladiators landing site.

## Quick start

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Where to put design assets

- `src/assets/` for exported images/SVGs
- `public/` for favicons and static files

## Routing

- `/` – Landing page
- `/privacy` – Privacy policy
- `/terms` – Terms

> Note: The provided zip you uploaded contained a React Router starter template without the actual Figma landing assets.
> If you export assets (images/SVGs/fonts) from Figma, drop them into `src/assets/` and update the section components.
